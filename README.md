Intersection of Racers that did The Wall, and Man vs Coast. 


## Man Vs Coast was Hard.
In the listings on the RatRace webpage, I found myself coming in at (Provisionally - 549 / 1000 or so runners). 

Middle of the Pack. 

But Melissa said - "I bet all those people didn't do The Wall a few weeks ago".

This sort of question cannot be answered with the tools that are provided by RatRace. 

So, I downloaded all the data I could get, and then cross referenced them.

## Findings : 
Out of the 98 People I could find that had the "Same Names" between both data sets. I placed 56th. 



## Algorithmic complexity? 
Yes. This is inefficient. But on a dataset that is ~1000 units, even with N Squared complexity, I am happy to wait rather than optimising on this problem.
